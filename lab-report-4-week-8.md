# Lab Report 4

## Snippet 1:

- Expeted Output:

- Peer's code:

- I think I do not need to make anychanges to my code, because the output of my code is the same with the expected output.
  
## Snippet 2:

- Expected Output:

- I think I cannot use a small code to correct the error. I think I need to use a stack to solve this issue, when the code find a "[", put it in the stack whenever it finds the "]" pop them out the stack, and read the information between this two stack. 


## Snippet 3:

- Expected Output:

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59184714/169657294-e50d6d19-d14a-4b67-85e8-0dc81b313e14.png)

- My code:

- Peer's code:

 - It is also difficult to fix the problem in small code, because I need to fix all the empty space, and I also need to fix the issue that without ")". I think to eliminate the empty space I can make the code to find the non-empty strings. In order to solve without ")", I can make the code to ignore all the content without the ")".
